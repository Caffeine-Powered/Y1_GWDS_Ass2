                            <h1>WHAT IS FOOD WASTE?</h1>
                            <p>
                                Food waste sounds disgusting, but what actually is it? Food Waste is simply food that is
                                not eaten,
                                and is thrown away during retail and consumption. Whilst this does include food that has
                                past its expiry
                                date, it includes food that "COULD" spoil quickly. This means food that is still more
                                than fresh and edible
                                is thrown away despite it still being good. This can be a range of goods, from fruit and
                                vegetables to
                                packaged and processed foods.
                            </p>
                            <h1>WHY IS FOOD WASTE AN ISSUE?</h1>
                            <p>
                                Food waste is produced in massive volumes, from homes and supermarkets throwing away
                                approximately 9.5 million
                                tonnes annually, most of which ends up in land fill sites. Most food waste breaks down
                                naturally, and this is not
                                seen as an issue by the majority of people, but food waste contributes heavily to global
                                warming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to this, much of the food waste that is taken to land fill sites to
                                decompose is still more than fresh
                                and edible. Millions of people around the world struggle with the cost of living or are
                                unable to feed themselves and
                                their families and we throw substantial quantities of it away before it has even left
                                the shelves of the supermarkets.
                                We at Cornerstone want to prevent food waste and provide food to those who might be
                                struggling.
                            </p>
                            <h1>TAKE AWAY?</h1>
                            <p>
                                In summary, food waste is not just "rotten" or "unusable". We understand that people
                                will always be sqeamish about the idea
                                of food waste, the name doesn't help, but we are here to prove that it is something that
                                is something you should consider
                                letting into your life.
